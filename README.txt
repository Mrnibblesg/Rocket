This is an HTML5/Javascript version of asteroids that I'm working on.

Controls:
a and d: rotate left and right respectively
w: blast off forwards
space bar: shoot laser, hold to keep shooting
 
 
 
Some extra information:
  When you shoot a laser, it plays a sound. It shouldn't be loud, it's set to 2% volume.
  Screen wrap is on, meaning if you go out of screen on one side, you come back out the other.
  Lasers don't wrap the screen and are removed once they exit.
  There's no limit on how fast you're able to go.
